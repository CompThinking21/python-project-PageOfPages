Neighborhood Search - a data retriever for city data
=================================================================

Introduction
============

Neighborhood Search is a simple python program that uses API calls to retrieve 
data on a specific city. With all important/relevant data at your disposal, 
you can learn about your city and how you can realistically live there. 

Neighborhood Search provides you with data to show you what your neighborhood 
will statistically provide for the average resident. Discover if this is 
an unrealistic town for you to move to or maybe discover the statistics of 
your town don't represent what you've experienced living there. 

- **General City Statistics:** - Do most people rent in your town and is this rent low? Does minimum wage meet the cost of rent? How long should you expect to be comuting everyday? Are there entry level occupations availble in your city?
- **Average Costs:** - How much is the cost of Grocceries? Will you be able to afford basics such as bread and eggs? How much is gas? Will you be able to make your comute without breaking your paycheck?


Setup
======
Clone this git.

In the terminal, navigate to the folder python-project-PageOfPages.

Run the python file neighborhood-search.py in the terminal.

```
$ python neighborhood-search.py

```

After a short introduction, you will be prompted to enter an address.


Future Picture
==================
A lot of city's accross America have an ever changing and growing apartment market. But what specific factors influence the price of an apartment? What external factors make an apartment that looks cheap actually a more expensive choice? What are the effects of the construction of new apartments in the center city and gentrification in outer parts of the city? What is the expectancy of the struggling low income workers and the reality of renting in a city today? 

Neighborhood Search will use data retrieval and visualization to highlight the conditions and pressures placed on low income groups looking for housing. What are their best options given current apartment prices versus minimum wage and cost of living. Furthermore, Neighborhood Search will detect where prices are going depending on surrounding factors. Are apartments getting more expensive, and if so, then why? Where are low income groups with no outter family financial support expected to live? And not just "live" in the sense of surviving... **live**.


Origin of Concept
=================
I got the idea for this project when I was looking at Zillow for apartments and just calculating out the realistic amount I'd need to make to live in an apartment. The math just didn't add up. And I'm an individual, I'm not even an entire family supported by one. I wanted more than anything for the site to turn gray/murky brown, the pictures to change to beat up awkward walls and unsafe/loud surroundings, and the listings to drop to realistic prices that matched typical low income circumstances. I just wanted a parady of this site that gave the reality of what I'd be getting without me having to be taunted by these better apartments that were just enough out of my budget. 

Ideally this project would become a site where you can enter an address and learn about what life you could realistically live there. Can you walk or take public transporatation to a supermarket or laundrymat? Are there local jobs available that are above minimum wage? If not, what is the minimum wage and can you afford rent on that? How many people need to room to lower the cost of rent if possible? How will you afford for a bed and kitchen table and other basic home necessities if this is your first apartment?
What about the luxaries in life - Are there local Deli's or pizza places or coffee shops? Is there a local gym or park to exercise in? 
How about general health - how bad is the pollution, how is the tap water (will you need to buy bottle water?), how easy is it to apply for government insurance? Can you afford therapy or over the counter medicine?
